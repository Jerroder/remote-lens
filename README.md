# Remote Lens

This is an iOS app which does not (and will never) require an account and connects to a Canon EOS R series (it may work with other models, likely M series too) cameras, take photos and add GPS tags to photos.

## Features

* Connect to Canon cameras using BLE without creating an account,
* Take a single photo or long press to take many in burst mode,
* Navigate the playback menu from your iPhone, without touching the camera,
* Use the intervalometer for timelapses,
* Add GPS tags in different ways (I don't know how people use this feature so I implemented 4 ways).

## Supported hardware

The following models have been tested:

* EOS R6

From what I read in other projects, the Canon R series and M series all have the same Bluetooth implementation but please let me know by creating an issue if your camera model works or not.

## Appendix

In order to complete or correct what's been documented in [Canon Bluetooth Control](https://github.com/3bl3gamer/canon-bluetooth-control), here's what I found:

* `00030011-0000-1000-0000-d8492fffa821` (`0xf309`) â€” result of switching modes
    - notifies with `01` before going into suspend

This isn't technically true, the camera notifies with `01` after writing `0x04` to `00030010-0000-1000-0000-d8492fffa821` (`0xf307`). The Canon Camera Connect app happens to write `0x04` before the camera goes to sleep, but the camera doesn't notify `01` by itself before going to sleep.
